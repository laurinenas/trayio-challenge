# Robotic hoover

This is a solution to programming challenge, described [here](https://gist.github.com/DavidJSimpsonEsq/71dcf396a2303ad5edd08690289d016d).Extensively uses [a package](https://github.com/laurinenas/robotic-hoover) that abstracts hoover movement logic away.

## Getting Started

Just run `git clone https://github.com/laurinenas/trayio-challenge && npm i && npm start` to get the script running.
It takes a file called `input.txt`, does the computations and returns `output.txt`
